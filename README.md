# Filka

HTTP service for filtering messages from Kafka.

The user can add a filter and the system starts to remember 
all new relevant messages to return them later on request.

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/alexsukhrin/filka

## Usage

Start kafka

    $ docker-compose up -d

This command starts the application using Docker. The `-d` flag runs the containers in detached mode, allowing you to continue using your terminal.

Run the project's tests (they'll fail until you edit them):

    $ clojure -T:build test
